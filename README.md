### Command Line

`rm` and filename removes (deletes) that individual file.

`rm -rf` is known as adding a "flag." `rm` is still the command, and `-rf` is the flag. `rf` stands for "recursive force." It deletes an entire directory and all its contents. (Don't use this in the root directory of your computer or you will wipe everything from your machine.)
